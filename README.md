# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease-with-XGBoost-Classifier
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. In this Python machine learning project, we learned to detect the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.  Hope you enjoyed this Python project. We have already provided you the links for more interesting Python Projects at the top of the blog.
